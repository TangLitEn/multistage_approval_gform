# multistage_approval_gform
A google app script that built up a multistage approval system where you can nest any Gform under the system and setup a workflow for the Gform. 

# Setting up of Approval Receipt

# Nesting of New Form into the system

1. Collect a VERIFIED EMAIL address. (Go to Form settings > Responses > Collect Email Address > Verified)
2. Set up the Google form as you want it to beðŸ˜‰ (Anything is okay, multiple sections, or attachments, all works!)
3. At the end, the most important step, is to link the response to the Multistage Approval Spreadsheet. (Go to Form Responses > link to sheets > Select existing spreadsheet > Multistage Approval Spreadsheet)
